Hey there! 👋

I'm Vignesh, a grad student at [NYU](https://nyu.edu), studying Computer Science with a focus on Systems. 

Lately, I've been putting off starting a blog for way too long...

But not anymore, so here we are!!

## but why start a blog?
Well, there are a few reasons:
- Writing forces me to understand things much better.
- Maybe future me will thank me for writing things down.
- And finally, being able to share what I've learned with the world!!

## what to expect?
I'll probably write posts about:
- systems programming
- web dev
- and solving LeetCode problems (T-T)

There's no fixed topic or schedule yet. 

## how did I set this blog up?
I'm going to be honest, I did [*vibe-code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibe_coding) this blog, but this was mainly because I wanted to prototype something really quick.

> **P.S.** I do want to reduce my dependence on AI moving forward

The overall theme is inspired by the aesthetic of my portfolio website.

I've built this blog using `Astro`, `MDX` and `Tailwind` and the whole site is hosted on `GitHub Pages`

I chose this stack because I wanted something **fast**, **simple**, and that lets me write in **plain markdown**.
